타고 가는 일반인들이 ‘아, 여기 문화회관이 있다.’라는 걸 시인할 수, 인지할 수 있도록 만들어 주는 그게 정문 활성화하고 귀결이 되는 겁니다. 그래 안 되면 그거는 제가 보니까 오는 사람들이 그냥 문화회관에 방문하는 사람들이 정문이 될 수밖에 없지 일반 우리 부산 시민이 느끼는 정문은 절대 될 수가 없습니다.\n","우리 부산 시민이 원하는 인지할 수 있는 정문이 되어 줘야지, 그래야 정문 활성화되는 것이지 그렇지 않으면 정문 활성화 안 됩니다. 그리고 문화회관이 있다고 생각하면 공연이 있든 없든 아, 여기는 가면 잠깐 내가 “내려, 내려, 내려.” 잠깐 여기 들리더라도 여유를 가지고, 여유를 가지고 조금 생각을 해 볼 수 있는 공간이라고 느끼고 차도 오게 만드는 그게 중요한 거거든요.\n","그런데

했습니까?\n","95년도입니다.\n","95년 몇 월입니까?\n","저희들이 소방행정타운 기본 및 실시설계 이전에 연산 파출소…\n","아니 지금 묻는 말에나 대답해 주세요. 연산 파출소는 계획은 95년 몇 월입니까? 지금 연산 파출소를 이야기하는 것입니다.\n","95년 10월입니다.\n","95년 10월이 확실합니까?\n","그다음 하반기에 가서…\n","아니 본위원이 연산 파출소 계획을 언제 하셨느냐 이것을 묻고 싶습니다. 왜냐하면 예산이라는 것은 불요불급한데 편성이 되어야 되는데 소방행정타운 이것이 연제 소방서가 건립이 된다면 조금 전에 설명하신 대로라면 연산 파출소는 계획이 없어야 되는 것입니다. 그러면 어느 것이 먼저였느냐 하는 거기에 따라서 제 질의가 들어갈 것입니다.\n","행정과장 이런 것 아닙니까? 소방 타운을 연산동 소재에 계획하기 이전에 연산 소방 파출소를 짓겠다는 계획을 한 것 아닙니까?\n","그렇게 답변하면 되는데…\n","아니 그것이 몇 월 정도로 했고 행정타운은 언제부터 계획이 되었는가를 묻고 싶습니다.\n","행정과장 보세요. 행정타운을 짓는다는 것은 꼭 연산동에 짓는다는 계획이 당초 계획이 아니거든요, 그러니까 그것이 늦게 되니까 그렇게 되었다는 것 아닙니까?\n","아니 본위원이 뭘 묻는지에 대해서 잘 모르시겠습니까?\n","알겠습니다. 그런데 연산 파출소 신축 계획이 95년도, 제대로 답변을 못 올려서 죄송합니다. 연산 파출소 신축 계획은 95년도 5월…\n","그러면 소방행정타운의 건립은 언제 계획이 된 것입니까?\n","95년 7월로 되어 있습니다.\n","95년 7월 95년 5월 사이는 몇 개월 차이입니까?\n","2개월 차이입니다.\n","우리가 행정타운 같은 것은 미래를 보고 아주 장기적인 계획에 들어가는 것입니다. 그런 계획을 세우면서 연산 파출소 건립과 연제 소방서의 건립을 혼동을 하신 것입니까, 연산 파출소를 먼저 지어야 되겠다는 것입니까? 그리고 그것이 지금 답변이 잘 맞지 않다는 생각이 드는 것은 95년 5월에 연산 파출소를 신축하겠다고 하면 96년도에 바로, 본예산은 보통 언제 합니까? 본예산을 그러면 소방행정타운의 예산도 11월쯤 들어가는 것 아닙니까, 본예산이. 그렇다면 두 달 사이에 어떻게 파출소 새로 신축하고 연산 소방서 신축하고 이것이 가능합니까? 여기에 대한 본부장님이나 행정과장님의 답변을 바랍니다.\n","제가 답변드리겠습니다. 답변드리기 전에 죄송한 말씀입니다마는 저희들 답변이 혼란이 생겨 가지고 서류를 제가 검토해 본 결과 92년도에 보니까 소방서 설치 5개년 계획 수립이 되어 있습니다. 그때 적어도 95년도나 96년도 연산 파출소가 생기는 것으로 이렇게 되어 있었고 그러면서 그다음에 94년 연말에 가서 갑자기 연산동에 타운 부지가 선정이 되어 가지고 관리전환이 되게 됩니다. 그러다 보니까 타운을 설치하게 되면 파출소가 필요 없고 연제 소방서에 직할 파출소로 들어가게 됩니다. 이래서 5개년 계획이 수정이 된 것으로 이렇게 보시면 되겠습니다.\n","5개년 계획이 수정이 된다는 것도 이해를 하겠습니다마는 본위원이 생각하기로는 이것이 불용액으로 4억 2,000이 연산 파출소 신축이라는 그 명목으로 예산이 배정된 것입니다. 그 시점은 본위원이 생각하기로는 95년 본예산이었거나 아니면 95년 추경이었거나 이렇게 추정할 수 있습니다. 그렇다면 소방행정타운은 지금 우리 본부장님 말씀대로 94년에 연산동에 타운이 생길 것을 예정을 했다 이러면 이것은 앞뒤가 맞지 않습니다.\n","연말에 그것이 어느 정도 관리전환이 되면서 청사 기본계획은 95년 7월 18일 날 되었거든요.\n","95년?\n","7월 18일 날.\n","기본계획이 되었다고 합시다.\n","되었으니까 그전에 파출소 신축 계획이 수정될 수밖에 없었습니다.\n","그러면 어떻게 예산이 반영이 됩니까?\n","예산하고는 관계없습니다.\n","예산은 그 이후잖아요?\n","예산을 올렸기 때문에 예산이 편성되어 가지고 지금 불용액으로 처리된 것 아닙니까?\n","죄송합니다. 그 당시에 그 업무를 직접 관장한 계장이 설명을 올려도 되겠습니까?\n","그렇게 하세요.\n","소방행정계장 <NAME>입니다.\n","제가 대신 답변을 올리겠습니다. 강위원 님 지적하신 사항이 상당히 먼저 타당성이 있다는 것을 먼저 인정하면서 답변드리겠습니다.\n","그 당시 행정타운 부지가 94년 연말자로 해서 확정이 되었습니다. 조금 전에 본부장님이 말씀하신 대로 연산 파출소는 92년부터 계획은 저희들이 기안이 되어 있었습니다마는 부지가 없으니까 기안만 되어 있고 실시를 하지를 못했습니다. 그러다가 94년도 5월에 기본계획을 수립해 놓았는데 95년 7월에 그 당시에 <NAME> 시장님이 오셔 가지고 행정타운 자체 결재를 하셨습니다. 그러다 보니까 연말이 되면 예산이
